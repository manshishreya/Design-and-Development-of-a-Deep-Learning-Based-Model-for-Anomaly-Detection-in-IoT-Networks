# Design-and-Development-of-a-Deep-Learning-Based-Model-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-IoT-Networks
Network intrusion detection System, which aims to evaluate different network data through various behavioral analyses of the network to ensure its security is maintained. It uses a deep learning-based model for multiclass and binary class traffic classification.
Here is the link for Datasets that we are using. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1h2egIG1TZlUpzRoW2JZxNqJUcqffk4fX
First Run IOT_DS2.ipynb file then run Instrusion.ipynb file. Size of dataset is so large, So training process is very time taking.
